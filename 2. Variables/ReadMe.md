**Simple Naming Conventions:**

- Interface: Adjective (e.g., _Runable_, _Readable_, _Remote_)
- Class: Noun (e.g., _Student_, _HashMap_)
- Method: Verb (e.g., _actionPerformed_, _run_, _read_)
- Variable: Name should define what the variable contains
- Contant: same as variable, but all caps (eg., _MAX_COUNT_); use underscore b/c all caps, can't camel case
