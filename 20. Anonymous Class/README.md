# Limits of Anonymous Class

- A normal class can implement any number of interfaces but the **_anonymous inner class can implement only one interface at a time_**.
- A regular class can extend a class and implement any number of interfaces simultaneously. But **\*anonymous Inner class can extend a class **OR** can implement an interface\*** but not both at a time.
- For regular/normal class, we can write any number of constructors but we canâ€™t write any constructor for anonymous Inner class because the anonymous class does not have any name and while defining constructor class name and constructor name must be same.
