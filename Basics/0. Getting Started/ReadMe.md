- Public: declares a member's access as public. Public members are visible to all other classes. This means that any other class can access a public field or method. Further, other classes can modify public fields unless the field is declared as final.
- Static: is available at the class level; you don't need to create an instance (or copy) of the class to access it. Applies to:
  - Blocks
  - Variables
  - Methods
  - Classes
- Void: specifies that a method should not have a return value.
