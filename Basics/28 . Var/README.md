# Local Variable Type Inference (Var)

- allows to define a variable using var and without specifying the type of it. The compiler infers the type of the variable using the value provided.

- This type inference is restricted to local variables. A **local variable** is a variable that is given local scope. A local variable reference in the function or block in which it is declared overrides the same variable name in the larger scope. In programming languages with only two levels of visibility, local variables are contrasted with global variables.

**Note:** Only assesible in JDK10+
