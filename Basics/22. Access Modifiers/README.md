- if creating a class, you can only used the modifiers: **abstract, final, public**

- best to make classes public, because if you leave it blank (default) you will not be able to access it if you export it within a package

- you can use private for an inner class

# Uses:

- **Private:** Specific Class
- **Default:** Specific Package (same as making it Private)
- **Public:** Any Class or Package
- **Protected:** Subsiding Class
